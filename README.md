# What to Watch
## Personal learning project.
This project uses an API from (https://www.themoviedb.com) to list movies and tv shows by:
* Top rated;
* Popularity;
* Latest;
* On air.

It also provides an option to search for a movie or a tv show by using its title. Thats if you want to, nobody's pushing you.
Things to do:
1. Re-make the styling of the other pages (other than the home.html which will be set as landing page).
2. Add more functionality to the pages.
3. Add more search options (by year, per actor(?), per rating).
