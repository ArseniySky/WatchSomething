# What to Watch
### About
This project uses an API from themoviedb.com in order to list movies & tv shows according to the following criteria:
* Latest;
* Popular (with set minimum and maximum dates);
* Top rated (of all time);
* On air (tv shows that are currently on air);
It also provides an option to Search for movies/tv shows by:
* Title;
* Actor/Actress name;
* Year (original year of release).
Currently working on adding more features (sorting listed movies by genres.).
#### Personal learning project.
##### I do not hold any ownership of the images used in this project. This project is currently for non-commercial use.

Things to do:
1. ~~Change the style of the pages to match the theme.~~
2. ~~Add more search options (by year, per actor).~~
3. Add more functionality to the pages.
4. Add option to filter movies/tv shows by Genres in (movies/tv shows by actor, year, top rated, popular, latest.)
