# What to Watch
## Personal learning project.
This project uses an API from (https://www.themoviedb.com) to list movies and tv shows by:
* Top rated;
* Popularity;
* Latest;
* On air.

It also provides an option to search for a movie or a tv show by using its title. Thats if you want to, nobody's pushing you.
Things to do:
1. ~~Change the style of the pages to match the theme. ~~
2. ~~Add more search options (by year, per actor).~~
3. Add more functionality to the pages.
4. Add option to filter movies by Genres in (movies by actor, year, top rated, popular, latest.)
