    <p> This project uses free API key from themoviedb.com.This page is created for learning purposes. It lists all the movies(latest, currently popular & top rated) and series(those on air, currently popular & top rated).It also has an option to search for a movie/tv show by title. For every movie and tv show, there's a details page, where it takes the ID of the movie/tv show stored in the Session Storage, and lists info about it. It includes a link to the IMDB page, YouTube trailer, a link to a subtitles page and also to thepiratebay (if you're into those pirate stuff..). It will be updated with new stuff regulary as I learn more and more.
